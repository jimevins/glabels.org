- This release supports rotated labels and cards. I.e. cards and labels that would normally default to a landscape orientation can now be rotated to a portrait orientation. (There are some problems with image objects in this rotated orientation during print-preview.)
- Text objects are now anti-aliased for a more WYSIWYG experience.
  - If you experience problems with text objects, this feature can be disabled by doing a "./configure --disable-hacktext" and recompiling.

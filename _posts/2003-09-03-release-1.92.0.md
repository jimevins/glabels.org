This latest development snapshot has been a long time in the making. Changes include

- Uses libgnomeprint-2.2
- Fixes a couple of crashes associated with image objects.
- A new property toolbar for changing common object properties "en masse."
- XML file formats have been cleaned up (see glabels-2.0.dtd).
  - Labels generated with 1.91.x should import automatically.
- Templates now support a waste attribute, so that background images can print beyond the edge of the label.

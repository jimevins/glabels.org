This latest development snapshot is primarily bug fixes, but includes a couple of interesting new features. Changes/fixes include

- Fixed button order in new label and label properties dialogs. (Wayne Schuller)
- Fixed a bug with the preferences dialog, which resulted in ignoring default object property preferences. (me)
- Fixed a bug which caused the waste property to function incorrectly on rectangular labels. (me)
- Added template designer assistant/wizard. (me)
- Added line spacing property to all text objects. (Wayne Schuller)
- Fixed bug in object editor size page which caused the height spin button to be ignored. (me)

{% include JB/setup %}

This is the first release with a document merge feature. The implementation of this feature may still be a little rough around the edges. Currently only a simple back-end for text files exists -- others are planned. The currently supported text-file format is very simple: each line is a record; fields are delimited by tabs, commas, or colons; and newlines can be embedded into records by using the "\n" entity.

Other changes include

- Some code clean-up.
- Updated Japanese language support, thanks to Takeshi Aihana. (0.3.4 functionality)
- Additional label templates.

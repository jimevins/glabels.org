This is the first snapshot of the 2.3.x development series. The purpose of this series is to preview and test code and features for glabels 3.0. Features and prerequisites are likely to change drastically from snapshot to snapshot. If you are not willing to put up with this or even things that may not work quite right yet, you should probably continue to use 2.2.8. Let the testing begin...

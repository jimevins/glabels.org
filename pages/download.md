## Third Party Packages

If you are not up to building and installing gLabels from source,
you may be able to use a third party package.  gLabels is currently available for many
popular GNU/Linux and BSD distributions through their associated repositories.

Some of these third party packages are more up to date than others.  If you experience
bugs or problems with a third party package that is not based on the most recent stable
version, please contact the package maintainer and urge them to update as soon as possible.


## Git
The latest bleading-edge version of gLabels can be cloned from its Github repository.
